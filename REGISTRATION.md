# Registration Information for "The Python Data Career Path"

This project is a self-paced educational book series, not a live event. As such, there is no formal registration page.

The books will be made available for purchase on major ebook platforms (such as Amazon Kindle) upon their release dates as 
specified in our project timeline. The project's public GitHub repository, which contains supplementary code and materials, 
is freely accessible to all.
