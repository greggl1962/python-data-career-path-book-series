# Project Funding Model for "The Python Data Career Path"

This project is being developed as a commercial ebook series that will be made available for purchase on platforms like Amazon Kindle. 
The goal is for the project to become self-sustaining through book sales, which will support the long-term maintenance of the code repository 
and the development of future educational materials.

We are not seeking corporate sponsorships for this project.

The grant being requested from the Python Software Foundation is specifically to offset the initial, one-time production 
costs (such as professional technical editing and cover design) required to bring a high-quality, valuable educational 
resource to the Python community. We are approaching the PSF for this seed funding because our primary goal—to lower the barrier of entry into 
data careers using Python—is in direct alignment with the Foundation's mission.
