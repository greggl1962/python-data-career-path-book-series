# Accessibility for "The Python Data Career Path"

We are committed to making this educational series as accessible as possible to a global audience. Accessibility for this project is ensured in the following ways:

* **Format:** The project is delivered as an ebook, a format which supports accessibility features like resizable text and compatibility with screen readers.
* **Pacing:** As a self-paced resource, learners can proceed at a speed that is comfortable for them, which is ideal for individuals with different learning styles and time commitments.
* **Global Reach:** The digital format allows the books to be distributed globally, reaching aspiring developers in regions who may not have access to in-person workshops or conferences.
* **Code Accessibility:** All code samples are provided in a public GitHub repository, making them accessible to assistive technologies and easy for learners to interact with.
