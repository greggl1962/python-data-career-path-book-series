# Project Schedule for "The Python Data Career Path"

As this project is a self-paced educational book series, there is no fixed, timed schedule like a live workshop.

The "schedule" for the learner is the chapter-by-chapter progression outlined in the Detailed Curriculum. 
The project is designed for motivated individuals to work through at their own pace.
